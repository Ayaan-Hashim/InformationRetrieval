This system is a basic information retrieval system tailored for the processing and querying of a dataset of text documents. At its core, it employs text pre-processing steps that include tokenization, normalization, stemming, and stopping. With these pre-processed tokens, the system is able to construct an inverted positional index, allowing for efficient retrieval of documents based on terms, phrases, or their proximity. 
Although the system is basic, with its implementation has helped reinforcing each concept it utilises, the system is also able to provide a sandbox to draw conclusions and further clarity into the world of information retrieval.
